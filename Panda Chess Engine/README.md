# Panda - Chess Engine
Made by: Sebastiano Rebonato-Scott

Current elo: ~1400

Reasons for the name:
- pandas are black and white (like a chessboard)
- pandas are friendly and not very dangerous (you can't exactly have an engine rated 1400 and call it something like Black Panther)
- pandas are pretty slow, kinda like my array-based move generation

Latest Update (search optimisations):
- do not detect mate on leaf nodes
- speed up recapture detection
- overall 80-90% increase in search speed

Todo:
- move ordering
- more detailed evaluation
- opening book
- uci protocol
