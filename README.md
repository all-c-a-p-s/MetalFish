current elo: 0

this is a high-school project i'm currently working on. it's made for fun and not with the aim of being a particularly strong engine.
todo:
- search function
    - quiescence
    - alpha-beta pruning
- evaluation function
- uci interface (will probably get moved to main.cpp rather than having its own file)
