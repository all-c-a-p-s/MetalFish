made by: Sebastiano Rebonato-Scott
current elo: ~900

this is a high-school project i'm currently working on. it's made for fun and not with the aim of being a particularly strong engine. It currently searches to a fixed depth of 5 for every move, and uses piece-square tables for evaluation.

todo:
- alpha-beta pruning
- quiescence function (doesn't exit search in positions where e.g. pieces are hanging)
    
- eopening book/endgame evaluation
- uci protocol
